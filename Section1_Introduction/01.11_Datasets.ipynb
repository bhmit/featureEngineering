    "## Example 1: Peer-to-Peer Lending (Finance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Business Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Peer-to-peer lending (abbreviated P2P) occurs when investors lend money directly to individuals or businesses through an online service. The online server provider matches lenders with borrowers, and conducts the analysis required to determine the loan interest rate to be charged to the borrower and the risk incurred by the lender. There is usually a lower operating cost to peer-to-peer lending, therefore investors tend to get higher returns and borrowers lower loan rates, although this is now always the case.\n",
